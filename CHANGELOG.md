## \[[0.8.0](https://github.com/holochain/tx5/compare/v0.7.2...v0.8.0)\] - 2025-08-28

### Bug Fixes

- Time out the WebRTC connection before timing out the connection attempt by @ThetaSinner in [#186](https://github.com/holochain/tx5/pull/186)

### Testing

- Make `base_timeout` test less flaky by @ThetaSinner in [#189](https://github.com/holochain/tx5/pull/189)
  - The test is currently blocking builds because it's stalling at some point in the test and preventing CI from making progress

## \[[0.7.2](https://github.com/holochain/tx5/compare/v0.7.1...v0.7.2)\] - 2025-08-26

### Bug Fixes

- Incompatible WebRtcConfig for go-pion by @ThetaSinner in [#184](https://github.com/holochain/tx5/pull/184)
- Log errors when tasks fail by @ThetaSinner in [#183](https://github.com/holochain/tx5/pull/183)

### Miscellaneous Tasks

- Add rust-analyzer and rust-src as toolchain components by @cdunster in [#180](https://github.com/holochain/tx5/pull/180)
- Use `getLib` for `LIBCLANG_PATH` instead of `.lib` by @cdunster
- Use `clang` from `llvmPackages` in Nix flake by @cdunster
  - This will make sure that `clang` and `libclang` are on the same version.
- Use systems list from `nixpkgs` for all supported systems by @cdunster
- Use github instead of local registry for flake-parts Nix input by @cdunster
  - They should be the same but this makes sure that they are if someone changes their local registry.
- Add direnv support with Nix and watching rust-toolchian by @cdunster in [#179](https://github.com/holochain/tx5/pull/179)
- Add Nix flake devShell by @cdunster

### Testing

- Add tests for connectivity resilience when the connection to the signal server is flaky by @ThetaSinner in [#167](https://github.com/holochain/tx5/pull/167)
