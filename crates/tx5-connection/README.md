P2P WebRTC connection establishment and pooling. Tx5 uses [SBD](https://github.com/holochain/sbd) as the WebRTC signaling protocol for connection establishment, providing an interface where you can attempt to send data to any known peer with the expectation that Tx5 will open a connection to that peer or use an existing open connection.

#### tx5-connection

Holochain webrtc connection.
Starts by sending messages over the sbd signal server, if we can
upgrade to a proper webrtc p2p connection, we do so.

#### WebRTC Backend Features

Tx5 can be backed currently by 1 of 2 backend webrtc libraries.

- <b><i>`*`DEFAULT`*`</i></b> `backend-go-pion` - The pion webrtc library
  writen in go (golang).
  - [https://github.com/pion/webrtc](https://github.com/pion/webrtc)
- `backend-webrtc-rs` - The rust webrtc library.
  - [https://github.com/webrtc-rs/webrtc](https://github.com/webrtc-rs/webrtc)

The go pion library is currently the default as it is more mature
and well tested, but comes with some overhead of calling into a different
memory/runtime. When the rust library is stable enough for holochain's
needs, we will switch the default. To switch now, or if you want to
make sure the backend doesn't change out from under you, set
no-default-features and explicitly enable the backend of your choice.
