//! Holochain webrtc connection.
//! Starts by sending messages over the sbd signal server, if we can
//! upgrade to a proper webrtc p2p connection, we do so.
//!
//! # WebRTC Backend Features
//!
//! Tx5 can be backed currently by 1 of 2 backend webrtc libraries.
//!
//! - <b><i>`*`DEFAULT`*`</i></b> `backend-go-pion` - The pion webrtc library
//!   writen in go (golang).
//!   - [https://github.com/pion/webrtc](https://github.com/pion/webrtc)
//! - `backend-webrtc-rs` - The rust webrtc library.
//!   - [https://github.com/webrtc-rs/webrtc](https://github.com/webrtc-rs/webrtc)
//!
//! The go pion library is currently the default as it is more mature
//! and well tested, but comes with some overhead of calling into a different
//! memory/runtime. When the rust library is stable enough for holochain's
//! needs, we will switch the default. To switch now, or if you want to
//! make sure the backend doesn't change out from under you, set
//! no-default-features and explicitly enable the backend of your choice.
