P2P WebRTC connection establishment and pooling. Tx5 uses [SBD](https://github.com/holochain/sbd) as the WebRTC signaling protocol for connection establishment, providing an interface where you can attempt to send data to any known peer with the expectation that Tx5 will open a connection to that peer or use an existing open connection.

#### tx5-go-pion-sys

Rust bindings to the go pion webrtc library.

Access the go-pion-webrtc api interface using the
pub once_cell::sync::Lazy static [API] handle.

WARNING - Only 1 single golang ffi binding is allowed per binary.
          If you attempt to include a second one, you will end up
          running 2 parallel garbage collectors that will step on
          each other and crash your program.

Golang ffi works better with static linking on platforms that support it.

Unfortunately, we also must support dynamic linking for Android and Windows.

Either way, the Go code exports two calls:
- "OnEvent" allows the go code to emit events to the rust library
- "Call" allows the rust libary to invoke functions within go

Every api passes through one of these two iterfaces.
