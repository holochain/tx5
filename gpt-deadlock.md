Looking at your code, I can identify several potential deadlock scenarios in the tx5-connection crate:

## Potential Deadlock Areas

### 1. Connection Ready Semaphore

In `Conn::ready()` method:
```rust
pub async fn ready(&self) {
    // this will error when we close the semaphore waking up the task
    let _ = self.ready.acquire().await;
}
```

This uses a zero-initialized semaphore that's only closed after the connection is established. A deadlock can occur if:
- The connection fails to be established properly
- The semaphore never gets closed with `task_core.ready.close()`
- Yet the connection object remains in a state that appears valid elsewhere

### 2. Signal Server Message Exchange Timeout

The handshake process in `con_task` might lead to deadlocks if messages aren't properly processed:
```rust
match tokio::time::timeout(
    task_core.config.signal_config.max_idle,
    handshake_fut,
).await
```

If a timeout occurs, the connection is closed with `client.close_peer(&task_core.pub_key).await`, but other parts of the system might not be notified properly.

### 3. WebRTC Connection Establishment

The code in `con_task_attempt_webrtc` creates complexity around fallback behavior:

```rust
if !is_ready {
    netaudit!(
        WARN,
        pub_key = ?task_core.pub_key,
        a = "webrtc fallback: failed to ready within timeout",
    );
    return Fallback(task_core);
}
```

This could leave connections in an ambiguous state if there's a race condition between the timeout and the actual WebRTC connection establishment.

### 4. Channel Deadlocks in Command Processing

The command processing in the various tasks uses bidirectional channels:
```rust
let (cmd_send, cmd_recv) = CloseSend::sized_channel(1024);
```

If one side of the channel closes unexpectedly or a loop that's supposed to drain a channel stops prematurely, it could lead to deadlocks in the communication between tasks.

## Root Cause Analysis

The most likely root cause of your issue is in the error handling around connection failures. When a connection fails, its resources might not be properly cleaned up, particularly the `ready` semaphore, which might never be closed, causing callers of `ready()` to wait indefinitely.

The complex state transitions between connection initialization, WebRTC establishment, and fallback to signal relay create multiple points where a connection could be left in a zombie state - appearing valid in some tracking structures but actually unusable.

Look particularly at how `con_task_attempt_webrtc` handles failures and returns the `Fallback` result - this maintains the `TaskCore` but might not properly clean up or reset all state.
